If progress report status is greater than or equal to 80% then supervisor can send request to admin to add defense for thesis. After admin add defense date, location, and examiner name , student can view information through thesis dashboard and examiner will allocate thesis marks to student.
### Note:
- One student cannot create another thesis until there is ongoing thesis.
- One student can send thesis approval request to one supervisor.
- Multiple thesis cannot be created until previous was accepted for supervision.
- supervisor cannot send thesis request to admin until report status >= 80%.
- admin assign one examiner for supervisor.
